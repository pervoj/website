On August 29th I became a member of the GNOME Foundation for my contributions to translations. I am very happy and feel a little more like a real member of the community.

Apart from that I decided to drop my "brand", I mean custom colors and my own design system attempt. I will now be using the GNOME project design system Adwaita. It looks beautiful, modern, is open source, â€¦ I'm not a designer, so this change will definitely be for the better.

So the website now has a new design using Adwaita style. I hope it looks good!
