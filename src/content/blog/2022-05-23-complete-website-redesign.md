So it's finally here! As I've been promising for some time, the new website is after a longer time done.

Unlike the old one, it represents me better and it has some technical advantages too. One of them, for example, is the use of my CSS library [Nuclear](https://pervoj.cz/nuclear/), which made development of the website much easier, and thanks to which the site supports e.g. dark mode. The library itsself is still under development, but since it is made for my personal use only, I plan to maintain it continuously without any stable release. The site also no longer uses Jekyll, but [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). Thanks to that is the website compilation much faster.

The blog is no longer a separate page, but it's completly integrated into this website. This makes the design more consistent and site maintenance much easier.

With the new design I will also try to write new posts more often.
