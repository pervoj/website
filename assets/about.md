My name is **Vojtěch Perník**, I'm a 15 years old student from the Czech Republic, who is passionate about code.

I got into programming in early 2020 when I wanted to follow my father's journey. I learned Java and I enjoyed it very much.

In September 2020 I completely switched to Linux and I still use Fedora today. At that time I became interested in GNOME and GTK and started learning Vala, followed by JavaScript and Python.
